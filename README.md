# Advanced-Visualisation
**Fourth Year (2023/2024) Advanced Graphics and Visualisation Module, Visualisation - 78%**

Creating and comparing 1) a 3D perspective map and a 2D isoline map for scientists and 2) a spherical globe visualisation for the public, for relief data. Including visualised topography with a very interactive interface. Using and transforming high quality images from [JHT's Planetary Pixel Emporium](https://planetpixelemporium.com/earth8081.html).

[Video Demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DnBhBDuwE-AH_5baxCm26qagy5furnVX/view?usp=sharing) showing the features implemented for the 3D and 2D maps. Please also see the paper of implementations for a comparison of techniques.
